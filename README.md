# PyLFG

## To use PyLFG to analyze sentences from a text file, follow these steps:

### Import the parse_sentence function from the PyLFG package:

Copy code
from PyLFG import parse_sentence

Open the text file containing the sentences you want to analyze. You can do this using the built-in open function:

Copy code
with open('path/to/text/file.txt', 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()

Split the text into a list of sentences using the split method:
Copy code
sentences = text.split('.')
Iterate over the list of sentences and pass each one to the parse_sentence function:
Copy code
for sentence in sentences:
    parse_tree = parse_sentence(sentence)
    print(parse_tree)
The parse_sentence function returns an object of type LFGParseTree, which can be used to access the various components of the parse tree. For example, you can access the root node of the parse tree using the root attribute:
Copy code
root_node = parse_tree.root
You can also access the children of a node using the children attribute:
Copy code
children = root_node.children
Each node in the parse tree has a label attribute, which indicates the type of the node (e.g. noun, verb, preposition). You can use this attribute to access specific parts of the parse tree:
Copy code
for node in children:
    if node.label == 'Noun':
        # do something with the noun node
    elif node.label == 'Verb':
        # do something with the verb node
    ...
You can also use the is_leaf method to check if a node is a leaf node (i.e. a terminal symbol):
Copy code
if node.is_leaf():
    # do something with the leaf node
