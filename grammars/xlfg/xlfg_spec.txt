ChatGpt Init Prompt

Hello, in this conversation we are going to talk about lexical functional grammar and our python package PyLFG. We are going to improve . PyLFG to make it the most comprehensive and performant state-of-the-art LFG parser. PyLFG will be used by linguistics university professors to teach the theory of Lexical Functional Grammar to their graduate students by teaching them how to write grammars and lexicons in the LFG formalism.

PyLFG will be also used by linguistics students to learn how to engineer LFG grammars by entering production rules and lexicons, and entering sentences to be analyzed. 

PyLFG will be also used by Linguistics academic researcher researching novel and state of the art theories and applications of LFG, such as the interface between phonology/syntax, morphology/syntax, semantics/syntax, theoretical syntactic theory, etc…

I am going to enter the code for PyLFG in multiple inputs. When you have understood the content of the document, just say “ok” and wait for my next input. When I am done inputting the data I will input “done”. Until then you must wait for my next input.
Here is the content of the xlfg standard LFG specification:
