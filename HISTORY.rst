0.1.0 (2023-26-01)
------------------

PyLFG version 0.1.0 alpha is now available! This release includes the following features:

- Tokenization: PyLFG can use custom tokenizers or Finite State Transformers for tokenization.
- Parsing: PyLFG uses a modified version of the C-Structure Earley parser to parse sentences and generate f-structures. This parser is based on the Earley algorithm, which is a top-down parsing algorithm that is well-suited for parsing context-free grammars. 🤖📝
- Visualization: PyLFG uses the Graphviz library to visualize f-structures. This allows users to create rich visualizations of f-structures, making it easy to understand and analyze the structures generated by the parser. 📊📈
- Terminal User Interface (experimental): PyLFG also provides a TUI which makes it easy for users to interact with the library, parse sentences and visualize the f-structures. 💻📱
- Web User Interface (experimental): PyLFG also provides a WebUI which makes it easy for users to interact with the library, parse sentences and visualize the f-structures.💻🌐
- PyLFG is compatible with Python 3.11 or higher, you'll be able to work with the latest and greatest tools in the Python ecosystem.🐍🛠️

Please note that this is an alpha release and not all features are currently implemented. We are still working on adding more features and improving the existing ones. However, this version is a promising start for PyLFG and we are excited to see how users will take advantage of these features. We look forward to receiving feedback and suggestions for future releases. 🚀🤩
